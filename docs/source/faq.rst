.. _faq-what-s-the-history-newfies-dialer:


What's the history behind Newfies-Dialer?
-----------------------------------------

**Answer:** .

Newfies-Dialer is a bulk dialer application which was commissioned by a charity named Kubatana (http://www.kubatana.net) based in Zimbabwe, which sponsors the Freedomfone project (http://www.freedomfone.org/) dedicated to providing information via phone technology.

In less economically developed countries, Internet is often limited, but there is usually comprehensive mobile phone coverage. Freedomfone uses Newfies-Dialer to dial up peopleâ€™s phones and offer health information on Cholera, Malaria and so many other avoidable health issues in the third world, which may be alleviated by education. Newfies-Dialer was so named after the Newfoundland Dog nicknamed Newfies and used by sea rescue services around the world.



.. _faq-how-does-tag-substitution-work:


How does the tag substitution work with the TTS engine?
-------------------------------------------------------

**Answer:** .

This is the list of standard tags that will be automatically replaced:
    {last_name}
    {first_name}
    {email}
    {country}
    {city}
    {contact}  // This is the phone number

If you need more flexibility, you can use the "Additional Parameters (Json)" field which allow you to add custom key-values that will be replaced.

For example, let's add this in "Additional Parameters (Json)":
    {"company_name": "Canonical", "bonus" : "200", "currency" : "euro"}

When you create a survey with a node that plays TTS, you can easily replace the key-values in the text.
Text example:
    "We are calling you on behalf of {company_name}, you receive a bonus of {bonus} {currency}"


.. _faq-how-provide-tts-in-multiple-languages:

----------------------------------------------------------

**Answer:** .

By default the TTS engine used by newfies-Dialer is Flite (http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/)
which only supports English. If you want to use another language you will need another TTS engine.

We have integrated Acapela: http://acapela-vaas.com/ and in order to use Acapela,
the only thing you have to do is to sign in and enable Acapela on Newfies-dialer.


.. _faq-how-enable-acapela:


How to enable Acapela on Newfies-Dialer?
----------------------------------------

**Answer:** .

First you will have to sign-up and register an account with Acapela : http://acapela-vaas.com/
Once you signed up you will receive a login, an application login and an application password, you will need those to configure Acapela on Newfies-Dialer.

Acapela needs to be configured in 2 places:

1. On the Web interface

Edit the file /usr/share/newfies-dialer/settings_local.py and find::

    #TEXT-TO-SPEECH
    #==============
    TTS_ENGINE = 'FLITE'  # FLITE, CEPSTRAL, ACAPELA

    ACCOUNT_LOGIN = 'EVAL_XXXX'
    APPLICATION_LOGIN = 'EVAL_XXXXXXX'
    APPLICATION_PASSWORD = 'XXXXXXXX'

    SERVICE_URL = 'http://vaas.acapela-group.com/Services/Synthesizer'
    QUALITY = '22k'  # 22k, 8k, 8ka, 8kmu
    ACAPELA_GENDER = 'W'
    ACAPELA_INTONATION = 'NORMAL'

    You will have to change the value of the settings : TTS_ENGINE, ACCOUNT_LOGIN, APPLICATION_LOGIN and APPLICATION_PASSWORD.


2. On the IVR application

Edit the file /usr/share/newfies-lua/libs/settings.lua and find::

    --
    -- Select the TTS engine, value : flite, acapela
    --
    TTS_ENGINE = 'flite'

    --
    -- Acapela TTS Settings
    --
    ACCOUNT_LOGIN = 'EVAL_VAAS'
    APPLICATION_LOGIN = 'EVAL_YYYYYYY'
    APPLICATION_PASSWORD = 'XXXXXXXX'

    SERVICE_URL = 'http://vaas.acapela-group.com/Services/Synthesizer'
    QUALITY = '22k'  -- 22k, 8k, 8ka, 8kmu
    ACAPELA_GENDER = 'W'
    ACAPELA_INTONATION = 'NORMAL'
    ACAPELA_LANG = 'EN'
