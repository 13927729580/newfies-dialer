.. _newfies-synopsis:

Newfies is an open source VoIP Dialer based on distributed message passing.
It has been built to support cloud based servers and can also work on standalone servers.
It uses `Freeswitch`_ (VoIP Server) to outbound calls, but support for other
VoIP Servers such as `Asterisk`_ could be easily added in the future.
The platform is focused on real-time operations and task call distributions
to clustered brokers and workers.

Newfies has been created to provide a solution for `FreedomeFone`_
to process millions of calls a day.

Newfies is written in Python, using the `Django`_ Framework. It also operates
with message brokers such as `RabbitMQ`_, `Redis`_ but support for Beanstalk,
MongoDB, CouchDB and DBMS is also available.

Newfies provides a comprehensive set of APIs to easily integrate the platform dialer
with third-party applications.

Using very simple steps, Newfies will help you create campaigns, add
phonebooks, contacts, build audio messages and create complex telephony
applications. Once your campaigns are ready to start, your messages
will be dispatched and delivered.

Overview
========

Newfies-Dialer can be installed and used by anyone who has a need for mass
outbound calling, voice broadcasting or providing outbound IVR. Some of the
potential uses for Newfies-Dialer are listed below.

The system may be installed and used by either companies who wish to make calls
on their own behalf, or by SaaS (Software as a Service) companies that want to
provide bulk dialling facilities to their own customers.

.. _newfies-dialer-utility:

Utility
=======
The system is loaded up with a list of telephone numbers that can be dialled
sequentially at very high rates of calling, several per second, depending on the
capacity of the carrier and the hardware.

When the called party answers the call, Newfies-Dialer passes the call to a telephony
application that is custom designed to provide the desired behaviour.

Below are some examples of some of the uses that Newfies-Dialer can be put to,
Please click on the headings for more details.


    * ``Telecasting``: Play marketing or informational messages to customers and clients.

    * ``Telemarketing``: Play a marketing message to potential customers, and give
      them the option to be put through to a call-centre via an IVR (Interactive Voice Response) Menu.

    * ``Phone Polling, Surveys and Voting``: Ring large numbers of people and present
      IVR options for either polling their opinions, interactive surveys, or taking
      their vote and record the results.

    * ``Debt Control``: Customers can be automatically reminded at intervals that
      they owe money, and an IVR menu presented to talk to the finance department
      or passed to a credit card capture IVR to pay over the phone.

    * ``Appointment reminders``: Doctors, Dentists, and other organisations that make
      appointments for their clients can integrate Newfies-Dialer into their
      appointment systems to pass a message reminding them of an upcoming appointment.

    * ``Dissemination of information via phone``: Newfies-Dialer was originally
      designed to call large numbers of people and disseminate medical and health advice
      via the ubiquitous cellphone in 3rd world countries where often, literacy
      levels are low. On a local scale, it can be used to disseminate information
      about forthcoming community events.

    * ``Mass Emergency broadcast``: Where there is a necessity to warn large numbers
      of people in a short space of time, such as weather warnings.

    * ``Voice Conferencing``: Attendees for a voice conference or podcast can be
      dialled up from a central location, and be connected in an audio conference room.

    * ``Subscription Reminders and Renewals``: Where a company sells an annual
      subscription for a product or service, Newfies-Dialer can be configured to
      dial the customer, remind them that the subscription is due, and optionally
      pass the call into a call centre or into a credit card payment IVR.
